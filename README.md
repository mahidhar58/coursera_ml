# IBM's Machine Learning with Python<br>
This project will import the previous loan data and trains 4 Machine learning models.<br>
The models are K-Near Neighbors, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression.<br>
After implementing the models, Jaccard score, F1 score and Log loss(only for Logistic Regression) are calculated.
